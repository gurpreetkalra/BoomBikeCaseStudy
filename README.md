## General Information

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those variables describe the bike demands Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions

The breakdown of the evaluation results for both the training and test datasets is as follows: Training dataset: The R-squared (R2) score is 0.823. The Adjusted R-squared score is 0.820. Test dataset: The R-squared (R2) score is 0.8037. The Adjusted R-squared score is 0.794. These scores suggest that the model performs well on unseen data, explaining around 80.37% of the variance in the test data.
The adjusted R-squared score is slightly lower but still provides a good measure of the model's performance.

Company should keep a close monitoring over the temperature and weather conditions. The collective effect of the same can also be understood by considering season as another important parameter to look upon.Special Arrangement should be kept to meet demands based on the above criterias.

There is a low user count visible when weather condition is not favourable , Different promotional schemes and incentives to take the rides should be given to boost people to use Services at that time. There could be also chances that bikes are not considred safe in such weather condition, some sort of trust campaign and safety measure drives should be introduced to let customers belive that riding with boom bikes is safe under such circumstances also.
